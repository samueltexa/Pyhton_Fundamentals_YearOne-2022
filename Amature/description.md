<!-- WHat is python -->
Python is a high-level, interpreted, object-oriented programming language designed by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.
<!-- It is known for its -->
    - clear
    - readable syntax
    - it emphasizes code readability
    -  and reduces the cost of program maintenance.
<!-- Key characteristics of Python include: -->
Interpreted:
            Python code is executed line by line by an interpreter rather than being compiled into machine code before execution.
Object-Oriented:
            It supports object-oriented programming, allowing for the creation of modular and reusable code through classes and objects.
High-Level:
            Python handles many low-level details, such as memory management, allowing developers to focus on higher-level problem-solving.
Dynamic Typing:
            Variable types are determined at runtime, offering flexibility in programming.
Extensive Standard Library:
            Python comes with a large collection of pre-built modules and packages that provide functionality for a wide range of tasks, from web development to scientific computing.
Versatility:
           It is a general-purpose language used in various domains, including web development (e.g., Django, Flask), data science and machine learning (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow), automation, scripting, and software development.
Open Source:
            Python is a community-driven, open-source language, meaning its source code is freely available, and a large community contributes to its development and ecosystem.
